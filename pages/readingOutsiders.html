        Scientists in the US believe the return of the white-tailed deer to many parts of the country may be responsible for spreading diseases carried by <span class="head" style="color: red"   >ticks</span> to humans. An estimated 30,000 people are <span class="head" style="color: red"   >infected</span> with Lyme disease every year, but other illnesses are <span class="head" style="color: red"   >emerging</span> that can be deadly. BBC correspondent Jane O'Brien reports:</p>
    <p>Babesiosis is a malaria-like illness that causes fever and <span class="head" id="nonchalant" style="color: red">nonchalant</span> and can prove <span class="head" id="gingerly" style="color: red">gingerly</span>. It's one of a handful of diseases carried by ticks that are that increasingly infecting people in the US. And while only a few hundred cases have been reported in recent years, scientists say that number is rapidly increasing. Dr. Peter Krause, a specialist at the Yale School of Public Health, says the ticks are carried by white-tailed deer that were once almost <span class="head" style="color: red"   >extinct</span> in parts of the country.</p>
    <p>"Deer are very important in the life cycle of the ticks that <span class="head" style="color: red"   >transmit</span> the diseases because they provide a place for the ticks to over winter, to <span class="head" style="color: red"   >reproduce</span> and to feed. And deer have <span class="head" style="color: red"   >markedly</span> increased over the past 50 years in the northeast of the United States due to reforestation."</p>
    <p>The return of the white-tailed deer is a conservation success story in America. But their numbers are now so great that many people regard them as a <span class="head" style="color: red"   >nuisance</span> and a potential health threat. <span class="head" style="color: red"  >Controlling</span> their population may be one way to help stop the spread of illnesses.</p>
    <p>
        "There have been a few studies showing that, with a marked reduction in number of deer, the number of ticks drops <span class="head" style="color: red"  >dramatically</span>, and in these studies the number of cases of Lyme disease drops dramatically. That's one of several <span class="head" style="color: red"  >approaches</span> that researchers are looking at."</p>
    <p>Other tick-borne diseases causing concern include Deer Tick Virus and Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis. As with Babesiosis, relatively few cases have been reported so far, but scientists say they're worried by the rising trend.</p>
