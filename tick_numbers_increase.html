Scientists in the US believe the return of the white-tailed deer to many parts of the
country may be responsible for spreading diseases carried by ticks to humans. An
estimated 30,000 people are <span id="2" class="head" style="color: red" data-synonyms="afflicted,sick"  data-example="Your children have infected you with this head cold.">infected</span> with Lyme disease every year, but other illnesses
are <span id="2" class="head" style="color: red" data-synonyms="appearing,developing"  data-example="Some nice results emerged from the study.">emerging</span> that can be deadly. BBC correspondent Jane O'Brien reports:
</p>
<p>
Babesiosis is a malaria-like illness that causes fever and fatigue and can prove fatal.
It's one of a handful of diseases carried by ticks that are that increasingly infecting
people in the US. And while only a few hundred cases have been reported in recent
years, scientists say that number is rapidly increasing. Dr. Peter Krause, a specialist at
the Yale School of Public Health, says the ticks are carried by white-tailed deer that
were once almost extinct in parts of the country.
</p>
<p>
"Deer are very important in the life cycle of the ticks that transmit the diseases
because they provide a place for the ticks to over winter, to reproduce and to feed.
And deer have markedly increased over the past 50 years in the northeast of the United
States due to reforestation."
</p>
<p>
The return of the white-tailed deer is a conservation success story in America. But
their numbers are now so great that many people regard them as a nuisance and a
potential health threat. Controlling their population may be one way to help stop the
spread of illnesses.
</p>
<p>
"There have been a few studies showing that, with a marked reduction in number of
deer, the number of ticks drops dramatically, and in these studies the number of
cases of Lyme disease drops dramatically. That's one of several approaches that
researchers are looking at."
</p>
<p>
Other tick-borne disease causing concern include Deer Tick Virus and Human
Granulocytic Anaplasmosis. As with Babesiosis, relatively few cases have been reported
so far, but scientists say they're worried by the rising trend.
